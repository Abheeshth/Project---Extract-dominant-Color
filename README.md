# Project---Extract-dominant-Color

### purpose 
1. this type of techniques is used in Image compression 
2. we want to extract some background in the image(at the cost of some features)



### what I have done  in this project

1. Image Segmentation
2. Segmentation partition an Imagge into regions having similar visiual appearance corresponding to parts of objects
3. I will try to extract the most dominant 'K' Color using K-means
4. We can apply K-means with each pixels will reassigned to the closet of the K-colors, leading to segmentation
